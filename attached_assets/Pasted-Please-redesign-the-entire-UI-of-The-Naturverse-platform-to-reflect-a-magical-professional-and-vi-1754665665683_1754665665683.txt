Please redesign the entire UI of The Naturverse™ platform to reflect a magical, professional, and visually stunning children’s fantasy world. Use the uploaded brand assets, illustrations, and character cards. Apply the following enhancements:

1. **Typography**: Use playful, bold, readable fonts for all headings (e.g., 'Fredoka', 'Baloo 2', or similar). Body text should be soft and legible, with enough spacing.

2. **Color Theme**: Apply a bright, warm, and magical color palette inspired by nature – soft greens, sky blues, golds, and glowing accents (not plain grey/white).

3. **Hero Sections**:
   - Each Zone (Learning Zone, Brain Games, Story Realm, Avatar Studio) should have a unique background and vibrant card layout.
   - Add hover animations and character image previews.
   - Ensure labels like "Ready to Explore" or "Locked" are colorful badges with fantasy icons (e.g. scroll, key, gem).

4. **Character Cards**:
   - Enlarge the cards and display in a carousel grid or gallery format.
   - Show name, region, and brief catchphrase.
   - Use your uploaded artwork instead of placeholders.

5. **Turian AI Assistant**:
   - Make Turian float, pulse, or animate slightly on the screen.
   - Add a colorful frame with a callout like: “💬 Ask Turian anything!”

6. **Navigation Bar**:
   - Use fantasy icons (e.g. books, stars, shields, maps).
   - Replace plain text icons with matching visuals.
   - Add a “🌎 Explore Map” and “🎵 Music Island” tab.

7. **Background**:
   - Soft textured background (like a magical scroll, faded map, or forest).
   - Add floating glowing particles or background animation for life.

8. **Fix Bugs**:
   - Fix the “users.name” column error in profile.
   - Ensure all text and labels are clearly visible on all screens.

9. **Responsive Design**:
   - Make everything mobile/tablet friendly with adaptive sizes and readable content.

10. **Custom Zones**:
   - Add “🎵 Music Island” with animated waves or sound buttons.
   - Add background environments to each zone (e.g., caves, floating gardens, volcanoes).

This should feel like a high-end, interactive, magical world where kids feel excited to explore, learn, and play — not like a blank template site.

Use uploaded character illustrations and icons as design inspiration. Make this feel like Pixar meets Dora meets Thai-fantasy-adventure. Keep all content readable, vibrant, and FUN.
