✅ MASTER MVP COMMAND (for Replit Agent)
Build my full Naturverse MVP app using React + Supabase, with the following setup:

🔐 AUTH + PROFILE
Supabase Auth: enable email/password, magic link, and OAuth logins

After login, redirect to a Profile Page where users can:

Upload/edit their avatar (store in Supabase Storage)

Edit and save their username

Store user data in Supabase users table (id, username, email, avatar_url)

Enable Row-Level Security (RLS) with policies allowing users to read/update their own data only

🌐 ROUTES & PAGES
Create modular React routes for:

/ → Home (welcome screen, description, login button if not authenticated)

/profile → Profile page (edit avatar + username)

/navatar → Navatar Creator (with category: fruit, animal, spirit, insect — store to avatars table)

/quests → Quest & Stamp Tracker (pull stamps from stamps table)

/map → Interactive Map of Thailandia

/quiz → Quiz Player (pull from quizzes and user_quiz_attempts tables)

/modules → List of Learning Modules (from learning_modules)

/music → Music Zone (basic layout for composing or playing music)

/storybook → Story Module Reader

/codex → User's saved content (like a personal library)

/ai → Turian AI Assistant (chat interface)

/market → Placeholder for Marketplace

/zone/:name → Dynamic route for each fantasy island/region (e.g. /zone/thailandia)

🧭 NAVIGATION + ROUTE PROTECTION
Navbar that shows only after login

Nav should link to all the main pages

Protected routes: redirect to login if not authenticated

💾 DATABASE
Use existing Supabase tables:

users (id, username, email, avatar_url, created_at)

avatars (id, user_id, name, category, image_url, appearance_data, created_at)

quizzes, user_quiz_attempts, stamps, learning_modules, notifications, feedback

🎨 STYLE + BEHAVIOR
Use TailwindCSS

Clean layout, loading states, error states

Modular components

All data connected via Supabase client with full CRUD

Let me know if you need the schema or file assets. Otherwise, generate and wire everything above now.
